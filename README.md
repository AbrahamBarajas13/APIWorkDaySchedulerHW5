# APIWorkDaySchedulerHW5
I was given code that had a preset skeleton to it, but I had to do the javascript and fill in the timeblocks for the code.
I also installed the moment.js library so I can keep the times updated along with making sure that the planner was able to save the data locally.
It also dynamically updates the css and html according to the current time.

USER STORY:
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
